# Advanced-Programming-Techniques
C++ for CUDA, OpenGL, Muti-thread, Socket, etc.

## Development Introduction
1.  Lab1: Multi-thread, Class
2.  Lab2: OpenMP for parallel calculations
3.  Lab3: OpenGL with OBJ files and Multiple Objects (3D)
4.  Lab4: CUDA-based 2D Random Walk Simulation
For each Lab, the mission statement is in the corresponding pdf.
